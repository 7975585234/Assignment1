# Assignment1
To run both frontend (HTML) and backend (Node.js) code in Visual Studio Code, you can follow these steps:

Ensure you have your HTML file (for the frontend) and your Node.js files (for the backend) in your project directory.

Open Visual Studio Code: Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to your project directory.

Split Terminal: Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by selecting Terminal from the top menu and choosing New Terminal. This will open a terminal at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window.

Run Backend (Node.js): In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Node.js files (where your index.js file is located). Use the node command to run your Node.js server. For example:

cd path/to/your/backend
node index.js
Run Frontend (HTML): Open your HTML file in a web browser. You can do this by right-clicking the HTML file in the file explorer on the left side of Visual Studio Code and selecting Open with Live Server (if you have the Live Server extension installed) or by simply opening the HTML file directly in a web browser.

With these steps, you'll be able to run both your frontend (HTML) and backend (Node.js) code simultaneously in Visual Studio Code. The backend server will be running in the terminal, and you can interact with your frontend application in the web browser.
